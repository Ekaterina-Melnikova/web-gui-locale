# Web Gui Locale

The eyeson default web GUI provided with the [API service](https://www.eyeson.com/developers/)
comes with locale for english (default, en) and german (de). Any additional
language support is community driven. Unfortunately we cannot ensure corectness
and completeness of such, however feel free to create a merge request and
suggest changes or even new languages yourself.
